# Project-11: QR Code Generator for Student Attendance

**Date:** September 07, 2024  
**Time:** 08:44 PM
## Overview
**P-11** is a QR code generator system aimed at automating student attendance. The idea is to generate a unique QR code for each class, which students scan to mark their attendance. This eliminates manual attendance tracking and reduces errors.

## Current Status
I'm in the early stages of the project, focusing on setting up the basics:

- **QR Code Generation**: Working on generating dynamic QR codes using Python's `qrcode` library.
- **Attendance Logging**: Setting up a basic attendance database (considering **SQLite** or **Google Sheets**).
- **Backend Setup**: Learning how to integrate **Flask** for tracking and storing attendance data.

## Next Steps
1. **QR Code Scanning**: Develop or integrate a mobile app for scanning QR codes.
2. **Real-time Updates**: Implement cloud integration (likely using **Google Sheets** or **Firebase**) for live attendance updates.
3. **Testing**: Create a mock environment to simulate the attendance process.

## Future Ideas
- **Automated Reports**: Generate attendance reports.
- **Mobile App**: Build a student-facing app for scanning QR codes and checking attendance history.
- **NFC Support**: Explore using NFC cards for faster check-ins.

## Conclusion
Project-11 is a work in progress. The focus is currently on building the foundation with QR code generation and basic backend integration, with future developments planned for real-time data, mobile apps, and NFC support.
